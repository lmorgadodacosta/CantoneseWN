# The Cantonese Wordnet

This repository contains the data for the Cantonese Wordnet project. This project was created and is continuously updated by Joanna Ut-Seong Sio (Palacký University, Czech Republic) and Luis Morgado da Costa (Palacký University, Czech Republic). 

Our wordnet contains data both in traditional characters and in Jyutping (a romanisation system for Cantonese developed by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong in 1993). The Cantonese wordnet is currently supported in two formats: 
 - the [Lexical Markup Framework](https://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/) (LMF) compatible XML, released and maintained by the [Global Wordnet Association](http://globalwordnet.org/);
 - a legacy TSV format adopted by the original version of the [Open Multilingual Wordnet](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/); (due to format constraints, not all data are available in the legacy format -- i.e. Jyutping forms). 

Currently the Cantonese Wordnet contains over 16,500 hand-checked lemmas and respective romanizations, distributed across all major parts-of-speech. More descriptive statistics and methodology can be found in its canonical citation (see below).
